## Hi there 👋🏻

My name is Sonny, and I am interested in all things Python & Data Science (with a healthy slice of SQL)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about reinforcement learning algorithms and their applications in algorithmic trading and portfolio optimization.
- 🤔 I’m looking for work! Specifically, I am interested in roles related to data science, IT, or software development.

##  Current Projects
- Developing [NovusEdge](https://github.com/arcturuscodez/NovusEdge), a comprehensive investment management software for Bearhouse Capital.
- Developing machine learning models for predictive analytics in finance.

## 🔭 Previous Experience
- Developed software [SCS](https://github.com/arcturuscodez/Spectral-Calibration-Software) to process and calibrate spectral data, specifically astrophysical maser emission data.
